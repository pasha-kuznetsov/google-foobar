LEVEL 1
======= 

Success! You've managed to infiltrate Commander Lambda's evil organization, and finally earned
yourself an entry-level position as a Minion on her space station. From here, you just might be
able to subvert her plans to use the LAMBCHOP doomsday device to destroy Bunny Planet.
Problem is, Minions are the lowest of the low in the Lambda hierarchy.
Better buck up and get working, or you'll never make it to the top...

Next time Bunny HQ needs someone to infiltrate a space station to rescue prisoners,
you're going to tell them to make sure stay up for 48 hours straight scrubbing toilets
is part of the job description. Its only fair to warn people, after all.

LEVEL 2
=======

You survived a week in Commander Lambda's organization, and you even managed to get yourself promoted.
Hooray! Henchmen still don't have the kind of security access you'll need to take down Commander Lambda,
though, so you'd better keep working. Chop chop!

At least all this time spent running errands all over Commander Lambda's space station have given you
a really good understanding of the station's layout. You'll need that when you're finally ready
to destroy the LAMBCHOP and rescue the bunny prisoners.


LEVEL 3
=======

Awesome! Commander Lambda was so impressed by your efforts that she's made you her personal assistant.
You'll be helping her directly with her work, which means you'll have access to all of her files-
including the ones on the LAMBCHOP doomsday device. This is the chance you've been waiting for.
Can you use your new access to finally topple Commander Lambda's evil empire?
